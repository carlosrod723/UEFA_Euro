### Project Overview

This repository contains three notebooks that I created for the Omdena UEFA Euro 2024 Analytics Project. Each notebook addresses a specific aspect of player and team performance analysis using various machine learning techniques and data from past UEFA Euro tournaments. Below is a brief description of each notebook:

**Top 5 Players Analysis (top_5_players.ipynb):**

This notebook analyzes the top-performing players in the UEFA Euro tournaments from 2012 to 2024. It identifies the top 5 players in each tournament based on various performance metrics such as goals, assists, and advanced metrics like expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xAG). The notebook uses a Random Forest Regressor, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, to predict player ratings and highlight key performance indicators.

**Home Advantage Influence (home_advantage_influence1.ipynb):**

This notebook investigates the impact of home advantage on match outcomes in UEFA Euro tournaments. It quantifies the influence of playing at home on team performance and match results using regression models, including Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. The analysis aims to understand how home advantage affects different performance metrics and overall team success in the tournament.

**Quantifying Team Strengths and Weaknesses (quantify_teams_kmeans.ipynb):**

This notebook focuses on analyzing team strengths and weaknesses by clustering teams based on historical match scores and performance statistics. Using K-means clustering, the notebook groups teams into clusters to identify patterns and similarities in their playing styles and performance. The analysis validates the clustering results with new data and provides insights into the key factors that contribute to team success in the UEFA Euro tournaments.

These notebooks collectively provide a comprehensive analysis of player and team performance in the UEFA Euro tournaments, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and rich datasets from fbref.com. The insights gained from these analyses can help coaches, analysts, and fans better understand the factors that influence success in the tournament.
